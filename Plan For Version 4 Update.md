!!!

We are planning to release Version 4 around the `end of May, 2024 or early June, 2024`. We are not sure about the exact date but we are doing our best to release it as soon as possible because we have been working on our third plugin named `Steam Integration Kit` and we are planning to release it soon.

## Important Planned Features

- **Cross Platform Friend System** : This is a custom friend system that is implemented by the developer. This means that the developer can implement their own friend system and use EOS to send friend requests and other friend related features. This is a very useful feature for games that are cross platform and want to have a friend system that is not dependent on Epic Friends.

- **Auto Login** : Auto Login is a feature that will allow the user to login automatically when they start the game. This will make it easier for the user to login and start playing the game. This feature will be optional and the user can disable it if they want. But this makes the login process easier and faster.

- **Console Support** : We are planning to add support for consoles like PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch. This will be a big update and will take some time to implement and we are doing our best to make it happen.

- **Complete SDK Implementation** : EOS Integration Plugin will have a complete EOS SDK implementation. This means that the developer can use the EOS SDK directly from the plugin and use all the features that EOS SDK provides. This will come in easy to use Blueprints and C++ functions.

- **Multiple Authentication Methods** : We are planning to add support for itch.io, Oculus, and all of the pending authentication methods. This will make it easier for the developers to integrate EOS with their games irrespective of the platform they are using.

- **Bug Fixes** : We are planning to fix all the bugs that have been reported by the users. We are grateful for the support and we are doing our best to fix all the bugs and make the plugin stable.

- **Documentation** : We are planning to update the documentation and make it more user friendly. We are planning to add more examples and tutorials to help the developers integrate EOS with their games.

- **Moving away from UE's Online Subsystem** : EIK started as a plugin that expanded on UE's EOS Online Subsystem. But we are planning to move away from UE's Online Subsystem and make EIK a standalone plugin. This means that the plugin has to be restructured and this will take some time. But this will make the plugin more stable and easier to use.
