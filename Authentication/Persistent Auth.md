Persistent Auth uses a session token to automatically log a user in once they have logged into their EOS account previously. If the session has expired or no session token exists, the user must log in via another method. 

!!!
This is usually used in combination with the [Account Portal](/Authentication/Account-Portal) authentication method to require the user to log in when no token is found.
