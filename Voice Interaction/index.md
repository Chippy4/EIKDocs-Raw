So voice chat is a very important part of any game, and we have made it very easy to integrate voice chat in your game.

### Setup
!!!info
From update 2.7, the following steps are not required. You can directly use the voice chat functions if you have setup the plugin correctly.
*For now*, you need to add these lines in your `DefaultEngine.ini` file
!!!

In DefaultEngine.ini, add these lines

```
[EOSVoiceChat]
bEnabled=True
ProductId=
SandboxId=
DeploymentId=
ClientId=
ClientSecret=
EncryptionKey=1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111112
