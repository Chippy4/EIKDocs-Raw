If you are using a login method like Account Portal or maybe, Steam login and it is again and again taking you to the login page or linking page, then we need to fix a small thing.

1. Go to [DevPortal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/en-US/), then select your organization and then go to your product page. On the product page, go to **Epic Account Services** and then **Permissions**.

2. Turn off the `Country` access requirement and save the changes.

!!! ðŸš¨ Some extra info
If, for some reason, you want the `Country` access requirement to be *ON*, then go the **Project Settings**, and lastly to the **EOS Integration Kit**, and turn on the Country Scope.
