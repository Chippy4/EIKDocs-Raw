Let's get started with installing EOS Integration Kit into your projects, which would be the easiest step, hopefully.

!!!danger üì¢ Important Precaution
To ensure seamless integration with the EOS Integration Kit, it is recommended to deactivate the default EOS plugins bundled with the Unreal Engine to avoid any potential conflicts.

Github has two way to get the files, one is the Normal Clone/Download and second is the Release Section. We suggest that you use the Releases version of the plugin for which the link is linked above.
1. Go the Github Releases Section and download the latest version for the version you are using.

2. Create a C++ Project OR if you have a Blueprint Project already, then just add a empty C++ class and that will do the job.
