Let's get started with installing EOS Integration Kit into your projects, which would be the easiest step, hopefully.

!!!danger üì¢ Important Precaution
To ensure seamless integration with the EOS Integration Kit, it is recommended to deactivate the default EOS plugins bundled with the Unreal Engine to avoid any potential conflicts.

### Github Edition

Github has two way to get the files, one is the Normal Clone/Download and second is the Release Section. We suggest that you use the Releases version of the plugin for which the link is linked above.
1. Go the GitHub Releases Section and download the latest version for the version you are using.

1. Create a C++ Project OR if you have a Blueprint Project already, then just add a empty C++ class and that will do the job.

3. Go to Project Explorer, then create a folder named Plugins and lastly paste the downloaded files in that folder.

5. Now open the .uproject file and probably, it may ask if you want to rebuild, which you can let it to and done.



!!!danger üì¢ This is only for Github Edition

If you are using the Github Edition, then you need to follow the below steps to get the plugin working on Mac, Linux and iOS.

1. Go to the Plugins folder and open the EOSIntegrationKit.uplugin file in a text editor.
2. You will see platform specific sections, where you need to add the Platform name which you want to add support for. For example, if you want to add support for Mac, then you need to add Mac in the WhitelistPlatforms section.
