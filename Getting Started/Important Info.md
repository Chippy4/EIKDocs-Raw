Although the plugin is made to be as easy to use as possible, there are a few things you should know before using it. This page will explain some important things about the plugin.

1. We suggest that you call the functions in the `Game Instance` and not in the Widget class. 
2. `Join EIK Session` only works when the two players are on different networks. If you are on the same network, you will get errors because of the same IP address. 
!!!warning
We are working on a fix for the above issue. This is not a issue of the plugin but the subsystem but we will try to fix it as soon as possible.
