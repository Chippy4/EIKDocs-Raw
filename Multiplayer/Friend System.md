There are two type of friend systems that can be implemented using EOS. Let us see what are those -> 

==- 1. Epic Friend System

This is the friend system that comes with EOS SDK, where all the friends you see are Epic Friends. This means that people can only use the friend feature if they login using EOS like AccountPortal, Persistent Auth etc OR they login using Steam and have connected/linked their steam account to Epic.

==- 2. Custom Cross Platform Friend System [!badge variant="warning" text="Upcoming Feature"]

Cross Platform Friend System is a custom friend system that is implemented by the developer. This means that the developer can implement their own friend system and use EOS to send friend requests and other friend related features. This is a very useful feature for games that are cross platform and want to have a friend system that is not dependent on Epic Friends.

## Epic Friend System

!!!warning
This is the only feature that still uses the old EIK Subsystem. This will be updated in the future to use the new Async System Nodes.
!!!

Setting up Epic Friend System is easy, just initialize EIK and it would be ready to use.
